# frozen_string_literal: true

# Finder for retrieving snippets that a user can see, optionally scoped to a
# project or snippets author.
#
# Basic usage:
#
#     user = User.find(1)
#
#     SnippetsFinder.new(user).execute
#
# To limit the snippets to a specific project, supply the `project:` option:
#
#     user = User.find(1)
#     project = Project.find(1)
#
#     SnippetsFinder.new(user, project: project).execute
#
# Limiting snippets to an author can be done by supplying the `author:` option:
#
#     user = User.find(1)
#     project = Project.find(1)
#
#     SnippetsFinder.new(user, author: user).execute
#
# To filter snippets using a specific visibility level, you can provide the
# `scope:` option:
#
#     user = User.find(1)
#     project = Project.find(1)
#
#     SnippetsFinder.new(user, author: user, scope: :are_public).execute
#
# Valid `scope:` values are:
#
# * `:are_private`
# * `:are_internal`
# * `:are_public`
#
# Any other value will be ignored.
